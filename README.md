# Dynamic changes in RNA-chromatin interactome promote endothelial dysfunction (NCOMMS-19-24818)

Repository of codes used in the paper "Dynamic changes in RNA-chromatin interactome promote endothelial dysfunction" (NCOMMS-19-24818).

## iMARGI


## Hi-C

All the codes and pipelines used for Hi-C data analysis and visualization are open source and available from the published software **[HiCtool (v2.1)](https://github.com/Zhong-Lab-UCSD/HiCtool)**.


## scRNA-seq

Two scripts were used for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, a bash script to run cellranger from 10X Genomics, and an R script to run Seurat functions for data analysis and visualization:

- [``cellranger.sh``](./scRNAseq_scripts/cellranger.sh)
- [``HUVEC_scRNAseq.r``](./scRNAseq_scripts/HUVEC_scRNAseq.r)
